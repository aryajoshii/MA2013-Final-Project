### Introduction
My project is an interactive desktop interface created in p5.js, allowing the user to interact with various elements as though they are exploring a real device belonging to someone else. The aim for this project was to expose what the different 'everyday' interfaces and platforms we use reveal about ourselves, perhaps without our knowledge. To do this, I looked at a few different key elements of a desktop; folders and applications, along with how teenagers typically decorate their desktop to make it more personalised to themselves.

I drew inspiration from my own digital archives for this project, by looking at the data my own social media platforms have gathered about me. From this, I looked at the concept of 'data portraits' and used this to represent data-related words in a creative format, such as taking some of my own Instagram follower's usernames and putting them in the shape of a 'like button'.

### How to Interact With my Project
There are a number of different mechanisms I have used for this project. Whilst some elements run independently of any user input, such as the notifications and random windows that pop up whilst the program is running, the apps and folders require interaction. For Spotify and Instagram, the screen is spammed with images when they are clicked, and this can only be stopped by clicking the stop button.

Similarly, the camera app uses the device's own camera and allows the user to interact with words on the screen using the ml5 libraries.

When clicking the 'uni work' folder, a small sphere pops up on the screen which continues expanding until the user clicks it to 'submit' their assignment. Whilst the sphere is expanding, there is a ticking noise playing to symbolise the time slipping away and when the user 'submits' their assignment they are rewarded with a 'ding' noise and a notification that praises them.

In addition to this, I have also created two interactive widgets which are on the desktop. There is a music widget and a 'to do list'. The music widget plays a song when the play button is clicked and the to do list has an itinerary which can be ticked off.
